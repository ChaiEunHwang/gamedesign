Rat Rangers : NYC Subway Cleanup Crew

I dove into the world of game development with zero experience this semester, and it's been a wild ride! At my coding studio class (@prattgradcomd), I spent the past 3 weeks crafting my very own game. 🕹️ From storyboards to coding, I embraced the challenge and had a blast every step of the way.

Inspired by late-night subway cleaners hustling along tracks, I had a quirky idea - what if NYC rats help their cleaning duties, making it safer for human workers? In my game, these resourceful rats not only clean up the mess but also contribute to recycling and upcycled art. ♻️

The first scene is set at Columbus Circle, where the rats apply for MTA transit cleaner and tackle the challenge of cleaning four tracks. I also wanted to sprinkle in a bit of eco-awareness, so all the littered garbage in the game is recyclable. Stay tuned for the next scene - the rats sorting recyclables! Planning to dive into that during winter break.

This whole process reminded me of the Maker Movement Manifesto - "Making is fundamental to what it means to be human. We just make, create, and express ourselves to feel whole." Couldn't agree more!</p>
